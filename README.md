# Booking Admin Panel

This project is an admin panel that provides various tools necessary to manage my BookingClone app. 

This part of application has not been deployed and is not available to test due to security concerns. I simply do not want to have my database flooded, so I will briefly present it to you.

Among other things, the application allows: 
- Browsing orders, users, hotels, rooms
- Updating various data,
- Creating new users, hotels and rooms
- Granting and revoking admin access to users
